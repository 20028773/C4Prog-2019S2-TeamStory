The Story so far....

Once upon a time in a un8iverse far awy (well any universe is going to be far away from this reality), there lived a unicorn.

Their (gender unspecific) name is Ewenee.

Ewenee was sat in their beautiful pink grass that was being fanned by a gentle breeze...

When suddenly a hail of bullets and meteroites tore up the land from the Skies above

Ewenee was hit by one the of the meteroites so hard they where all but obliterated from this plane of existance
