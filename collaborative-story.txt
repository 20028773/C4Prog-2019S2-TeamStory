The Story so far....

Once upon a time in a universe far awy (well any universe is going to be far away from this reality), there lived a unicorn.

Their (gender unspecific) name is Ewenee.

Ewenee was sat in their beautiful pink grass that was being fanned by a gentle breeze...

As Ewenee sat enjoying the pleasant afternoon weather a boeing 747 fell out of the sky like some kind of unholy meteor, and crushed poor Ewenee.

And thats the tale of the last unicorn.
