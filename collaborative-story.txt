On warm-summer days like these you can find Ewenee in her favourite park you can see the beautiful pink grass being fanned 
by a gentle breeze, the rich scenery provided by the tall overpowering mountains, the sound made by the purple exotic trees.
See Ewenee (or Yuni) was enjoying her day out in the sun. she was sat down on an indistinctable wooden bench 
that she had grown familiar with during her lonely childhood. 

"Gosh today is so nice, I wonder what they're up to?" she mutters to herself. Being in a family of 100 is surprisingly lonely.
she was always like this ever since she was an infant, always having conversations with herself. She knew alot about the world;
the different sounds the birds made, the shapes of rocks that she had climbed, the faces of the people she saw 
and the very thing most of us has forgotten, the sound of silence.
